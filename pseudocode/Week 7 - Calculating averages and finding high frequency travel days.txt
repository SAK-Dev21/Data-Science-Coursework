    # Step 1: Load Cleaned Dataset
    LOAD dataset "Trips_Full_Data-cleaned.csv"

    # Step 2: Compute Weekly Averages
    GROUP data by "Week of Date"
    COMPUTE mean of "Population Staying at Home" → STORE as "weekly_avg_stay_home"
    COMPUTE mean of "Total Travel Distance" (only for travelers) → STORE as "weekly_avg_distance"

    # Step 3: Create Histogram Visualisations
    PLOT histogram for weekly_avg_stay_home
    PLOT histogram for weekly_avg_distance
    LABEL axes and add title

    # Step 4: Identify High-Frequency Travel Days
    FILTER rows where "Trips 10-25 Miles" > 10,000,000 → STORE as "shortTrips"
    FILTER rows where "Trips 50-100 Miles" > 10,000,000 → STORE as "longTrips"

    # Step 5: Create Scatter Plot for High-Frequency Travel Days
    PLOT scatter plot with:
        - X-axis = "Date"
        - Y-axis = "Trips"
        - Data points from shortTrips and longTrips
    LABEL axes and add title

    # Step 6: Version Control
